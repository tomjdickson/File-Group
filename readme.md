# File-Group

This is script was developed to easily pull all files to a root directory.


# Constraints
There is currently an issue with the config file and the way the data is imported into the script. If you have a directory with (for example) `\Users\` \U is an escape character. If you would like to use this script and have a directory similar to the above then comment out the config part of the script and uncomment the two variables "src" and "dst".
